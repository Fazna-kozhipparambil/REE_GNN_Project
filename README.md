# REE_GNN_Project
Modeling the Impact of Tariffs on Global Rare Earth Trade using GNN
This project analyzes trade flows and tariff impacts on rare earth elements (REEs) using UN Comtrade and World Tariff data. It involves:

Data cleaning and merging
Visualizing trade trends
Simulating tariff impacts
Modeling trade networks using a Graph Neural Network (GNN)
